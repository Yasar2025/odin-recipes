        <p>Sweet Pongal, also known as Sakkarai Pongal or Chakkara Pongal, is a cherished South Indian dessert, especially significant during the Pongal harvest festival. It's a creamy, rich, and flavorful dish made primarily from raw rice, moong dal (yellow lentils), and jaggery (unrefined cane sugar).</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Raw Rice</li>
            <li>Moong Dal (Yellow Split Lentils)</li>
            <li>Jaggery</li>
            <li>Ghee</li>
            <li>Cardamom Powder</li>
            <li>Cashews</li>
            <li>Raisins</li>
            <li>Water</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Prepare the Rice and Moong Dal</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wash the rice and moong dal thoroughly in several changes of water.</li>
                    <li>You can optionally dry-roast the moong dal in a pan over low heat for a few minutes until a slight aroma arises. This can enhance its flavor.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><b>Cook the Rice and Moong Dal</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a pot or pressure cooker, combine the washed rice and moong dal with the required amount of water (usually about 2-3 times the volume of rice and dal)</li>
                    <li>Cook until the rice and dal are very soft and mushy. If using a pot, this will take longer. If using a pressure cooker, cook for a few whistles (usually 3-4) on medium heat and let the pressure release naturally. The mixture should be easily mashable.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><b>Prepare the Jaggery Syrup</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a separate saucepan, add the jaggery and a little water (just enough to dissolve the jaggery).</li>
                    <li>Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring continuously until the jaggery is completely dissolved and you have a smooth syrup.</li>
                    <li>Strain the jaggery syrup through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any impurities.</li>
                </ul>
                
            <li><b>Combine the Cooked Rice-Dal and Jaggery Syrup</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pour the strained jaggery syrup into the pot with the cooked rice and moong dal.</li>
                    <li>Mix well and cook on low to medium heat, stirring continuously, until the mixture thickens and the flavors meld together. Be careful as it can splatter.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li><b>Add Ghee and Cardamom</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add a generous amount of ghee to the Pongal and mix well. The ghee adds richness and a beautiful sheen.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the cardamom powder for its fragrant aroma.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><b>Roast the Nuts and Raisins (Garnish)</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a small pan, heat some ghee.</li>
                    <li>Add the cashews and roast them until they turn light golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Add the raisins and saut√© until they plump up. Be careful not to burn them.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><b>Garnish and Serve</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pour the roasted cashews and raisins along with the ghee into the Sweet Pongal and mix gently.</li>
                    <li>If using, add a tiny pinch of edible camphor or nutmeg powder at this stage.</li>
                    <li>Serve the Sweet Pongal hot or warm. It's often enjoyed as a prasadam or a festive dessert.</li>
                </ul>
        </ol>
