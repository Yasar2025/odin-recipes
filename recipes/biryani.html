        <p>Biryani is a rice-based dish from the Indian subcontinent, typically featuring long-grain rice (like basmati) layered with spiced meat or vegetables. It's known for its aromatic blend of spices, herbs, and often, fragrant elements like saffron and rosewater. The rice is often cooked separately and then layered with the meat or vegetables, which are also seasoned and often marinated.
